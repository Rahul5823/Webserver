Vulnerabilities Found

Directory Traversal

My Webserver is susceptible to Directory Traversal attack. With the help of this attack, attacker can access credentials and sensitive data of the user from the webserver.

Replication Procedure

1. Send a specific request to the webserver in the form of URL which targets the sensitive pages such as 'https://webserver_url.com/../../etc/passwd', which contains the information of each and every registered user.
2. After sending the request via URL, wait for the servers response.
3. The attack is successful, if the server shows the requested files.

Prevention Methods

1. We need to create a whitelist in which it contains the users along with their IP address or MAC address, whom can only access some important pages.
2. Use Web Application Firewall(WAF) to filter out malicious requests.
3. Implement some access controls to avoid exploiting webserver's privileges.

SQL Injection

In this attack, attackers can run unauthorized SQL queries to gain sensitive information from the webserver.

Replication Procedure

1. Go to the affected login page and input SQl injection string as the input for the username or email address, such as `' OR '1'='1`.
2. For the password, we can choose any text as it doesn't make any difference.
3. If the attack is successful, attackers can login as the admin.

Prevention Methods

1. Checking the input of the credentials first, insteading of directly executing them.
2. Eliminate any type of SQL injections before giving them any database privileges.
3. Use Web Application Firewall(WAF) to filter out malicious requests.

Cross-Site Scripting(XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting is a type of attack in which attackers can run arbitrary Javasscript in browsers.

Replication Procedure

1. Access the compromised webpage of the webserver. For example, 'https://webserver_url.com/search'.
2. Enter the XSS code such as '<script>alert('This page is pwned')</script>' in the search box of the website.
3. If the attack is successful, website shows an alert on the top-middle of the page.

Prevention Methods

1. Apply Content Security Policy(CSP) headers to decrease the scope of attacks like XSS.
2. Read and check the request before it is executed to avoid unauthorized exploiting.
3. Use Web Application Firewall(WAF) to filter out malicious requests.
